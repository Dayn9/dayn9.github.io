EVA is a project I've been working on with the [University of Rochester Stroke Center](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/stroke-center.aspx) and the [RIT MAGIC center](https://www.rit.edu/magic/) that uses games to help stroke patients with the recovery process. The project is actively being used in stroke research and uses EMG (electromyography) to sense muscle activations and control the game.
